The **Yet Another RussNet** (YARN) project was initiated in 2013 and aims at creating a large open WordNet-like machine-readable thesaurus for the Russian language through crowdsourcing. The project _objectives_ include creating the thesaurus, developing free and libré open source software to operate with it, designing the necessary data schemes and models, writing technical and user documentation. The thesaurus is available for download <https://russianword.net/yarn.xml> under the [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

## Documentation

We use both XML and CSV formats to represent our import and export data. Please consult the [format specification](https://nlpub.ru/YARN/Format) on NLPub, which is available in English.
